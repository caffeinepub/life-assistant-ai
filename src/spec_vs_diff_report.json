  "summary": "ChatPage.tsx replaces the prior message scroller with a flex-based, fixed-height/overflow-y auto container and adds bottom-aware, smooth native auto-scroll using the container’s scrollTo API. The diff shows conditional auto-scroll (only when previously at/near bottom) and scroll position tracking via onScroll; no edits were made under frontend/src/components/ui.",
